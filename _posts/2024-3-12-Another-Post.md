The Rain

Scars

Cancer

It isn't just the way you hold yourself but also the 
energy that will be seen by others. Do not let it be
you. Can you detect the same strangeness others see 
you? Simply: No. Just libe and exist as a human and 
play the game. You hold the same instincts but 
are still not in the same way. Let the observations
obtained through life to guide you. It does not matter
if you want this life, its a matter of survival. 

What then becomes of you? Nothing more than others are.
Its best to be one. It may be exhausting but thats the
just a sacrifice. 

Thank you.
