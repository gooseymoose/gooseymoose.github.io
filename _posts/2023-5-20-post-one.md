title: Holding the "KEY"
---

The main rules of holding yourself in social settings:

**Eye Contact**

Doesn't mean looking directly in someone's eyes. Looking at someones face is                the main point to show engagement

**Timing**

Generally do not over stay your welcome, looking for keys through their                     body language and others in the same social settings

**Contributions**

Must contribute to a conversation within a group conversation by addressing other's comments. Only add when it can lead conversations to a larger discussion

**Exiting Conversations**

Tricky topic. Look for signs of disinterests (lowering tones, body language, disengagement or distracted party). Ending should end with expressing gratitude for conversing, mention main topic and inviting ending to a future conversation.
